Question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Answer:

Used the LogisticRegression algorithm from scikit-learn.

# Results:

Logistic Regression Model: Accuracy: 99%

# Precision:

For label 0 (healthy loan): 1.00 For label 1 (high-risk loan): 0.85

# Recall:

For label 0 (healthy loan): 0.99 For label 1 (high-risk loan): 0.91

# Summary:

The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans. It achieved high accuracy, with precision and recall scores indicating strong predictive capability for identifying both classes.

Recommendation:

The logistic regression model is recommended for use in credit risk analysis due to its high accuracy and balanced performance in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans. The model's performance is crucially balanced between predicting healthy loans (0) and identifying high-risk loans (1). This balance ensures that both types of predictions are reliable, which is essential in financial risk assessment. Overall, based on the analysis and results obtained, the logistic regression model appears to be well-suited for this task.
